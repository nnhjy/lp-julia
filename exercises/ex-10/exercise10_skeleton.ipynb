    "and a solution $\\bar{x} = (0, 2/3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)$ to its LP relaxation. Find a cover inequality cutting out the fractional solution $\\bar{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could list all covers and their corresponding inequalities, but the easier way to find a violated cover inequality is to formulate *the separation problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the cover inequalities are of the form $\\sum_{j \\in C} x_j \\le |C|-1$, which can be rearranged as $\\sum_{j \\in C} (1-x_j) \\ge 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the separation problem is as follows: find a violated cover inequality such that $C$ is a cover. This leads us to the separation problem (as a combinatorial optimization problem)\n",
