    "\n",
    "Consider a centralised depot, from which deliveries are supposed to be made from. The delivers have to be made to a number of clients, and each client has a specific demand. Some assumptions we will consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The deliveries have to be made by vehicles that are of limited capacity; \n",
    "* Multiple routes are created, and a single vehicle is assignmed to each route; \n",
    "* We assume that the number of vehicles is not a limitation.\n",

    "Our objective is to define **optimal routes** such that the total distance travelled is minimised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem structure and input data\n",

    "Let us define the elements that form our problem. You will notice that we use a graph-based notation, referring to elements such as arcs and nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structural elements\n",
    "* $n$ is the total number of clients\n",
    "* $N$ is the *set* of clients, with $N = \\{2, \\dots, n+1\\}$\n",
    "* $V$ is the set of *nodes*, representing a depot (node 1) and the clients (nodes $i \\in N$). Thus $V = \\{1\\} \\cup N$.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Parameters (input data structure)\n",
    "* $C_{i,j}$ - cost of travelling via arc $(i,j) \\in A$ (equals distance between $i$ and $j$);\n",
    "* $Q$ - vehicle capacity in units;\n",

Suppose we know the travel time $T_{ij}$ through arc $(i,j)$ and service time $S_j$ for each node $j \\in N$. The time windows and service times are only defined for client nodes. For the depot, the departure time should be nonnegative and there is no service time. How can we model this additional restriction on client time windows?"
